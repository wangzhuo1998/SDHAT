## Introduction

Cloud contamination is a common problem in optical remote sensing images, which can seriously affect the performance of semantic segmentation models. To address this issue, this project proposes **PLCSeg**, a SAR-guided progressive learning method for semantic segmentation of cloudy remote sensing images.

The proposed method uses SAR images as auxiliary guidance to improve the feature representation of cloudy optical images and progressively enhance the segmentation performance under cloud-covered conditions.

## Features

* Semantic segmentation of cloudy remote sensing images
* SAR-guided feature learning
* Progressive learning strategy
* Cloud-robust segmentation framework
* Python-based implementation
